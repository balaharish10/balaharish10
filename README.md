Hello there
I am Balaharish,I am a kinda person who's always inquisitive about Technology and fond of moving further. I am very much interested in cloud computing and its dialects. I get to practice different frameworks and new techs everyday which pushes my scope wider everytime. Currently I am more focused on salesforce.

Here are some of my works
- A Movie Review App created with Flutter -[Movie Buff](https://github.com/balaharish10/yellowclass_assignment)
- A Chat App created with flutter - [Chat](https://github.com/balaharish10/chat_app_)
